# EmbeddedSecurity
  This project is based on PRESENT and ANU ciphers.Both of these ciphers are ultra-lightweight ciphers which find their application in embedded systems.<br>
  
  These algorithms are suitable for 8, 16, 32 bit systems.<br>
  
  Building blocks of cipher designing :
<ul>
  <li>S block.</li>
   <li>Bit permutation.</li>
   <li>Block permutation.</li>
   <li>Circular Shift. </li>
</ul>

P.S. This project is a documentation of Dr. G.V.Bansod's Ph.D. in the same topic
